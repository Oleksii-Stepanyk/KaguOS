# Welcome!
Welcome to KaguOS - learning framework for operating system design.

The main idea of this project is to emulate work of CPU and it's interaction with RAM to build our own simple operating system. Note, that this emulation is using string as a unit of RAM instead of byte. This allows to monitor state of RAM easily by monitoring tmp/RAM.txt file. 

We are using bash functions to emulate basic operations like cpu instructions and fetch-decode-execute loop.

# Environment
Bash shell of 5.2+ version is required to run the KaguOS emulation.

The preffered way is to use Ubuntu multipass virtual machine. In case of Linux and MacOS you can also use an alternative way to run KaguOS without multipass.

## Installation for Linux, MacOS and Windows(with multipass)
* Go to https://multipass.run/install and follow the instructions.
* Open Terminal or PowerShell and create new . You can use any name you like instead of **noble**.
```bash
multipass launch 24.04 --name noble
```
* Start your VM if needed:
```bash
multipass start noble
```
* Stop a virtual machine:
```bash
multipass stop noble
```
* Open a shell inside virtual machine:
```bash
multipass shell noble
```

## Ubuntu(without multipass)
On Ubuntu linux you should get all you need from the box.

## MacOS(without multipass)
By default MacOS is delivered with an outdated version of bash. To update it you can use the following steps.
* Open Terminal and check bash version with command **bash -v** .
* Install brew by executing of the following command(see brew.sh for details ):
    **/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"**
* Install bash
    **brew install bash**
* Edit config file for shells with command **sudo nano /etc/shells** by adding the line **/usr/local/bin/bash** before other paths.
* Press **Ctrl+O** and **Enter** to write your changes. Exit from editor with **Ctrl+X**.
* Reopen Terminal and check version of bash **bash -v** .

# General approach
For educational purpose KaguOS has simplified computation scheme to make debug and monitoring easy. Some core principles we are using:

1. The computation unit of KaguOS cpu is a string instead of byte or machine word in a real CPU. As a result our RAM is just an array of strings which can be dumped to the file and can be easily monitored. This allows us to avoid conversion from binary form and the data inside. As you will see for almost all the cases we are using short strings let's say <=16 bytes. Therefore such a model can be easily converted to a 128bit CPU(machine word is 16bytes) if we will limit our strings with that value 16.

2. Each string in RAM has it's own address starting from 1. We are using that addresses to perform calculations. For example we can copy data from address 42 to address 16. And that operation is the most frequently used.

3. Each string in RAM may represent some instruction or data or free space that can be used for dynamic memory management.

4. CPU registers, display and keyboard buffers are mapped to the start of RAM to make our system consistent and simplify monitoring of both RAM and register.

5. CPU has a set of supported operations. The regular flow is to copy data from some addresses to some of the registers(REG_A, REG_B, REG_C, REG_D) based on the specification(instructionSet.html, include/operations.sh). Then operation code OP_* should be copied to REG_OP and after that we can call cpu exec instruction. Result of calculation will be stored to either REG_RES or REG_BOOL_RES depending on the type of operation. For more information see the next subsection **How to work with KaguOS**.

6. By default system executes instruction one by one e.g. if we start execution from address 41 then corresponding string in RAM will be parsed and executed if possible(otherwise you get a fatal error). Then the program counter will be incremented and address 42 will be treated as the instruction and so on.

7. To change the sequence of instructions we can use jumps(both conditional *jump_if* and unconditional *jump*) which will set program counter to the specified address. Therefore corresponding line will be considered as the next program instruction to be executed.

8. Kernel should be run with `bootloader.sh` script. You can use debug options like -j -s and also special instructions `DEBUG_ON` or `DEBUG_OFF` to enable or disable debug functionality and dumping of RAM into `tmp/RAM.txt` file.

# How to work with KaguOS
The simplest way to run KaguOS is to use command `./bootloader <path to kernel disk>`
The kernel disk itself contains a list of lines with machine codes and some constant data that may be required to run that instructions.

To write a single instruction we should know the proper format and machine codes. Basic instructions and cpu operations are listed in files *instructionSet.html* and *include/operations.sh*. The list of addresses of different registers can be found in `include/registers.sh`. For simplicity we map all the registers to the start of the RAM.

As a result our kernel will be loaded at some higher address which is defined by ao constant `KERNEL_START` in *include/system.sh*. It is 41 by default which means that you should add 40 to the line number of the kernel disk to find its address in RAM after load.

## Simple kernel
Let's write a simple kernel which will stops execution immediately after start.
To do that we should copy value OP_HALT(code 30) from some address to REG_OP(mapped to address 2 in RAM). It can be done with `INSTR_COPY_FROM_TO_ADDRESS`(code 1). Then we can use `INSTR_CPU_EXEC`(code 0) to execute the real operation - cpu will check the operation code and will perform corresponding calculations.

There is one issue here - to copy OP_HALT code 30 it should be stored somewhere in kernel disk. We can append it after all the kernel instructions.
Our kernel disk will look like:
```
1 ? 2       # INSTR_COPY_FROM_TO_ADDRESS ?(unknown address) REG_OP
0           # INSTR_CPU_EXEC
30          # OP_HALT code - the address of this memory should be substituted in 1 ? 2 instead of ?
```
The last step here is to determine the address of that last line after loading it to RAM. As it was mentioned above the first line of the kernel disk will be loaded to the line `KERNEL_START`(value 41). Therefore the line with OP_HALT code will be at address 43. Let's complete our code:
```bash
1 43 2
0
30
```
Create a folder `kernels` with command `mkdir kernels` and create `simple` file to store the list of instructions. You can use `nano kernels/simple` or any other editor you like. Use empty line at the end of the file to ensure that file will be parsed properly.

Now let's run the kernel with command `./bootloader.sh kernels/simple`. It should produce a single line *CPU halt*. We can rerun it with a special flag `-j`(e.g. `./bootloader.sh kernels/simple -j`) that will print debug information about executed instructions.

To get more details we can notice that there is a new folder `tmp` with a file `RAM.txt` inside. This file contains a state of RAM at each point of time. It is dumped via `dump_RAM_to_file` call inside `bootloader.sh` to provide us debug capabilities. Further when you will write a bigger kernel you may need to add DEBUG_OFF and DEBUG_ON lines to disable that dumping and speed up the run of the kernel. But at the moment we will monitor what is happened inside RAM to understand the data flow.

Let's open `tmp/RAM.txt` in VSCode editor. You can find the kernel code starting from the line 41. To monitor state of RAM easily we should add a delay between instructions. We can specify the length of this delay in seconds with `-s=` flag of `bootloader.sh`.
Therefore review `tmp/RAM.txt` while running kernel with 0.5 second delay e.g. `./bootloader.sh kernels/simple -s=0.5`. There are only 2 changes in RAM - address 2(REG_OP) and address 24 which corresponds to `PROGRAM_COUNTER`(see *include/registers.sh*). Note, that in our implementation program counter contains value of line with instruction but this value is decremented by 1. Therefore PROGRAM_COUNTER register value 40 means execution of instruction at the address 41 and so on.

## Display message
Now let's extend our kernel with some useful actions. Let's print some message before halt. To do that we will use DISPLAY_BUFFER(address 18), DISPLAY_COLOR(address 20) and OP_DISPLAY_LN(code 20). Supported colors are specified in the file `include/others.sh`. We will use COLOR_GREEN(code 1).
```bash
1 ? 18          # copy string with text from ? address to DISPLAY_BUFFER(18)
1 ? 20          # copy COLOR_GREEN(1) constant from ? address to DISPLAY_COLOR(20)
1 ? 2           # copy OP_DISPLAY_LN(20) constant from ? address to REG_OP(2)
0               # cpu_exec
1 ? 2           # copy OP_HALT(30) constant from ? address to REG_OP(2)
0               # cpu_exec
Green hello!    # Text to be printed
1               # COLOR_GREEN constant
20              # OP_DISPLAY_LN constant
30              # OP_HALT constant
```

Now we can replace ? with the addresses were constants will be present in RAM. Text *Green hello!* is at line 7 at kernel disk therefore it will be at address 47 in RAM. Other constants will be calculated in the same way.
```bash
1 47 18
1 48 20
1 49 2
0
1 50 2
0
Green hello!
1
20
30
```
Create file `kernels/hello`, add the code and run it with `bootloader.sh`.

Let's extend our kernel with another message displayed in COLOR_RED(3):
```bash
1 51 18
1 52 20
1 53 2
0
1 54 18
1 55 20
1 56 2
0
1 57 2
0
Green hello!
1
20
Red hello!
3
20
30
```
Save it as `kernels/helloRed` and run it.

**TASK**: Rewrite the last kernel to reduce memory usage in this case if possible.

## Read input
Let's use `OP_READ_INPUT`(18) to get some text from the keyboard and display it instead of *Green hello!* message. Note, that in this case input will be stored inside `KEYBOARD_BUFFER`(address 22 in RAM).
```bash
1 ? 2           # write OP_READ_INPUT from ? address to REG_OP
0               # cpu_exec
1 22 18         # copy from KEYBOARD_BUFFER(address 22) to DISPLAY_BUFFER
1 ?  20         # copy COLOR_GREEN from ? address to DISPLAY_COLOR
1 ?  2          # copy OP_DISPLAY_LN from ? address to REG_OP
0               # cpu_exec
1 ?  18         # copy text Red hello! from ? address to DISPLAY_BUFFER
1 ?  20         # copy COLOR_RED from ? address to DISPLAY_COLOR
1 ?  2          # copy OP_DISPLAY_LN from ? address to REG_OP
0               # cpu_exec
1 ? 2           # copy OP_HALT from ? address to REG_OP(2)
0               # cpu_exec
18              # OP_READ_INPUT
1               # COLOR_GREEN
20              # OP_DISPLAY_LN
Red hello!      # Text to be printed in red
3               # COLOR_RED
20              # OP_DISPLAY_LN
30              # OP_HALT
```
Now we can calculate addresses of the constants and replace ?. The first ? should be replaced with 53 and so on:
```bash
1 53 2
0
1 22 18
1 54 20
1 55 2
0
1 56 18
1 57 20
1 58 2
0
1 59 2
0
18
1
20
Red hello!
3
20
30
```
Save the code to *kernels/readInput* and run it.

**TASK**: display some text before reading input to provide some hint for the user.

## Check condition
Now we can consider conditional execution of code. We have unconditional jump INSTR_JUMP(code 3) and conditional INSTR_JUMP_IF(code 4). As a part of this instruction you can specify address of the next instruction to be executed. INSTR_JUMP_IF will perform that jump only if REG_BOOL_RES(address 14) contains 1. Note, that REG_BOOL_RES is set during execution of some of logical operations, for example, OP_CMP_EQ and OP_CMP_NEQ allow to compare values from REG_A and REG_B.

Let's use conditional jump to check user input and print user input only if it is not equal to "red".

```bash
1 ? 2           # write OP_READ_INPUT from ? address to REG_OP
0               # cpu_exec
1 22 4          # copy from KEYBOARD_BUFFER(address 22) to REG_A(address 4)
1 ? 6           # copy constant "red" from ? address to REG_B(address 6)
1 ? 2           # copy OP_CMP_EQ from ? address to REG_OP
0               # cpu_exec
4 ??            # perform INSTR_JUMP_IF(code 4) to the instruction related to Red hello!
1 22 18         # copy from KEYBOARD_BUFFER(address 22) to DISPLAY_BUFFER
1 ?  20         # copy COLOR_GREEN from ? address to DISPLAY_COLOR
1 ?  2          # copy OP_DISPLAY_LN from ? address to REG_OP
0               # cpu_exec
1 ?  18         # copy text Red hello! from ? address to DISPLAY_BUFFER
1 ?  20         # copy COLOR_RED from ? address to DISPLAY_COLOR
1 ?  2          # copy OP_DISPLAY_LN from ? address to REG_OP
0               # cpu_exec
1 ? 2           # copy OP_HALT from ? address to REG_OP(2)
0               # cpu_exec
18              # OP_READ_INPUT
red             # text that will be used for the comparison
8               # OP_CMP_EQ
1               # COLOR_GREEN
20              # OP_DISPLAY_LN
Red hello!      # Text to be printed in red
3               # COLOR_RED
20              # OP_DISPLAY_LN
30              # OP_HALT
```
After calculations we can substitute ? with the real addresses. First line with data OP_READ_INPUT is at line 18 therefore we should start from 58 while filling missed addresses. Also ?? will be replaced with 52(as the instruction to jump is at line 12 of the kernel disk). As a result:
```bash
1 58 2
0
1 22 4
1 59 6
1 60 2
0
4 52
1 22 18
1 61 20
1 62 2
0
1 63 18
1 64 20
1 65 2
0  
1 66 2 
0
18
red
8
1
20
Red hello!
3
20
30
```
Save it to `kernel/condition` and run it. Enter text *red* and ensure that it will not be printed with green color. Restart kernel and enter any other text and ensure that logic is working fine.

**TASK**: Adjust the kernel so it will run in loop and will prompt user input until the user enter exit.

**TASK**: Create a program to calculate sum of two numbers. E.g. user should be prompted for input in format `15 + 2`, press enter and then program should output the result; incorrect format should be handled too. Note, you can find the list of operations in *instructionSet.html* and *include/operations.sh*. OP_GET_COLUMN and OP_IS_NUM should be a good choice fot this task.

# KaguAsm language

As we saw earlier, manually writing machine code requires significant attention and is prone to errors due to the many manual calculations involved.

To address these challenges, we developed a simple assembler language that makes writing code for KaguOS much easier. The key features of this language include support for labels, jumps, and variables, along with the `write` function. The language also allows the use of constants such as `REG_OP`, `OP_READ_INPUT`, `COLOR_RED`, and others directly in the code. The `asm.sh` compiler handles address calculations and automatically generates the kernel.

## Syntax
Here some main ascpects of the language syntax:
* Each command should be placed on its own line.
* Supported commands are `write`, `copy`, `jump`, `jump_if`, `cpu_exec`, `DEBUG_ON`, `DEBUG_OFF`. Also you can use keyword `to` for `write` and `copy` commands.
* We can declare variable with `var someName` and label with `label otherName`. You can refer to them with `var:someName` and `label:otherName` correspondingly. 
* The names of the labels and variables should start with a letter and contain only letters, digits and _ symbol. 
* You can use comments started with `//` symbols in a separate line.
* Inline commets are allowed too(`jump 100 // some comment`).
* You can use constants from *include/registers.sh*, *include/operations.sh*, and *include/other.sh* for example, `copy REG_RES to DISPLAY_BUFFER`, `write OP_HALT to REG_OP`, `write "some text" to REG_A`
* You can use `*` just before address if corresponding address contains address number with a real data. For example, if `REG_RES` contains value `100` then `copy *REG_RES to REG_A` is equivalent to `copy 100 to REG_A`.
* You can use `@` with variables to copy variable address somewhere. For example, `copy @var:someVar to REG_A` will store the address of the variable to `REG_A`.

## How to run
You can compile your source files using command `./asm.sh path/to/file.kga path/to/otherFile.kga`. That files will be processed in the provided order and merged to a single compiled kernel saved to the file **build/kernel.disk**. After compilation you can use `./bootloader.sh build/kernel.disk` to run the kernel.

## VSCode extension
We have an extension to highlight syntax of KaguOS assembler language. Use the following steps to install it:
1. Download *.vsix file from the latest release on https://github.com/vovaskochko/VSCodeKaguLangSupport/releases 
2. In VSCode go to extensions tab and select ... => Install from VSIX... => choose the file downloaded during previous step.
3. Enjoy!

## Examples
Let's create a simple source file `simple.kga` and add some instructions to display a text and exit:
```
write "Hello!" to DISPLAY_BUFFER
write COLOR_GREEN to DISPLAY_COLOR
write OP_DISPLAY_LN to REG_OP
cpu_exec
write OP_HALT to REG_OP
cpu_exec
```
Now we can compiler it `./asm.sh simple.kga` and run with `./bootloader.sh build/kernel.disk -j`.

Let's use a label for infinite loop:
```
label startKernel // the kernel start
    write "Hello! How are you?" to DISPLAY_BUFFER
    write COLOR_GREEN to DISPLAY_COLOR
    write OP_DISPLAY_LN to REG_OP
    cpu_exec
    write OP_READ_INPUT to REG_OP
    cpu_exec
    jump label:startKernel

// The code below is not reached as the loop above is infinite
label exit // jump here if you want to exit
    write OP_HALT to REG_OP
    cpu_exec
```
**TASK**: Extend the code with some logic to be able to exit from the loop.

**TASK**: Write a code to use `if else` idiom for some handling of user input.

**TASK**: Write a do-while loop to print user input 5 times.

**TASK**: Declare variable with `var someName` and use it to store data from `KEYBOARD_BUFFER` e.g. `copy KEYBOARD_BUFFER to var:someName`. And then display the data from variable.

## `asm.sh` implementation

1. The assembler processes all .kga files provided by the user, analyzing each line sequentially. Empty lines and comments are ignored immediately.

2. For all other lines, the first word is read and analyzed. This word must be one of the supported commands (`write`, `copy`, `jump`, `jump_if`, `cpu_exec`, `DEBUG_ON`, `DEBUG_OFF`) or declarations (`var` in `var name` for variables or `label` in `label name` for labels). Based on this first word, the expected number of lexemes is determined. For example, the `write` command requires 4 lexemes, plus the possibility of a comment at the end of the line, so a total of 5 lexemes is checked. Valid patterns for these lexemes are predefined and will be explained later.

3. Each lexeme undergoes analysis via the `parse_lexeme` function. This function determines the lexeme's data type and whether it has an additional prefix (`*` or `@`). If there is no prefix, the default `_` is added. Consequently, every lexeme is converted into a string format where:

* The first character represents the prefix.

* A space follows the prefix.

* The next three characters represent the lexeme type.

* Another space separates the type from the lexeme's value.
For example:
`_ cmd write` corresponds to the word `write`.
`* var name` corresponds to the lexeme `*var:name`.
`_ lbl labelName` corresponds to the lexeme `label:labelname`.
The first five characters of the formatted lexeme (prefix + type) are crucial for pattern validation.

4. For example, valid patterns for the jump or jump_if commands look like:
`^(_ cmd)(_ num|\* num|\* reg|_ lbl|\* var)(_ cmt)$`
This pattern means the following. The first lexeme must be the command itself (`_ cmd`). The second lexeme can be: a plain number (`_ num`), a pointer to a number, register, or variable (`* num`, `* reg`, `* var`), or a label (`_ lbl`). The optional third lexeme is a comment (`_ cmt`).

5. For each line, the assembler collects the lexeme types and validates them against the predefined regex pattern. This eliminates most errors early in the process. Remaining errors, such as using undeclared variables or jumping to non-existent labels, are checked later in subsequent passes.

6. Separate auxiliary arrays are maintained for variables, labels, and constants. These arrays are used to verify whether a label exists, whether a variable was declared and when, which memory should be allocated for constants and variables.

7. Only valid instructions are added to the `PARSED_LEXEMES` list, excluding variable and label declarations (as these perform no actual operation). Special debug strings, such as `line $CUR_LINE_NO`, are added to help pinpoint where errors occurred later in the process.

8. After parsing all instructions, the assembler calculates memory addresses for constants and variables. It dumps the parsed lexeme schema into a file for better visualization.

9. Next, the assembler processes the `PARSED_LEXEMES` array. You can find a dump of the array inside **build/kernel.disk.o** file. By this stage, the structure and types of all components are guaranteed to be correct. For each instruction:

- the required number of lexemes is read
- their values are evaluated using the `eval_lexeme` function. This determines the memory address, instruction code, or constant substitution.
- debug information for each lexeme is generated using `eval_debug_info_for_lexeme`.

10. The resulting machine code is written to **build/kernel.disk**. The assembler formats the output file to align comments neatly. It appends constants and allocates memory spaces for variables at the end of **build/kernel.disk**.

11. Finally, the compilation process is complete, and the assembler provides status feedback to the user.
