prompt 1:
using arithmetic operations and without bitwise operations, 
how can I check if someone has write permission (2),
if I can have permission from 0 to 7

prompt 2:
In my chmod implementation, I can change only one type of permission,
but I can do it either for all or for the particular group (user, group, other)
Define my algorithm for processing permission flags (e.g., +x or g+u) 
and define the scope of changing and my algorithm for assigning new permissions with the fewest steps 
(Assume changing permission is just changing a number, but permissions are not in a 777 format but in 7 7 7).
